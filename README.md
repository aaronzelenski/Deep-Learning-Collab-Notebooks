# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects – Winter 2025

This repository contains a series of deep learning labs completed as part of the **CS 474: Deep Learning** course at **Brigham Young University (Winter 2025)**. Each notebook explores a key topic in modern deep learning using PyTorch, with an emphasis on building models from scratch and gaining hands-on intuition.

## 🗂️ Notebooks Overview

- `pytorch_intro.ipynb` – Introduction to PyTorch tensors and automatic differentiation.
- `modules_and_training.ipynb` – Building and training models using `nn.Module`.
- `convnets_cross_entropy.ipynb` – Convolutional neural networks and loss functions.
- `unets.ipynb` – U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks.
- `generalization.ipynb` – Understanding generalization in neural networks.
- `regularization.ipynb` – L2 regularization and its impact on model performance.
- `style_transfer.ipynb` – Implementing neural style transfer with pretrained models.
- `transfer_learning.ipynb` – Fine-tuning pretrained models for bird classification.
- `diffusion_models.ipynb` – Introduction to diffusion-based generative models.
- `reinforcement_learning.ipynb` – Policy learning via reinforcement learning in a grid environment.
